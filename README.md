Handmade Engine
===============

This is a WIP game engine, written from scratch in the spirit of [Handmade
Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

This project is initially being written C using low-level Linux libraries,
primarily as a learning experience. The project will transition to using
higher-level libraries (OpenGL/AL) and C++ in the future.
